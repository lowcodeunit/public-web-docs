# Introduction to Launch Pads and Templates

Fathym Platform gives users intuitive and comprehensive workflows for assembling and launching applications and integrating them with APIs (IoT Ensemble, Habistack or external APIs). Fathym also goes a step further than this through pre-configured automations.

Instead of assembling, importing and deploying an app and manually integrating with APIs via API proxies, you can also take advantage of pre-configured automations that launch all the open-source frontend templates, API integrations or even cloud resources you need for various application use cases.

## Low-Code Units (LCUs)

In Fathym’s system, pre-configured automations and launch pads are referred to as Low-Code Units (LCUs). Without getting bogged down in jargon, we will provide a quick overview here as you will see the term LCU pop up.

LCUs are essentially curated code packages that can be deployed to your Fathym enterprise, composable automations of all sorts of software components, configurations and services. These flexible packages are versatile and can range from instructions for creating repositories and scaffolding code, to installing API configurations or deploying cloud resources or app templates. They are building blocks for efficiently assembling and deploying applications in the cloud.

For example, there are LCUs for launching SPA starter apps, for setting up, scaffolding and deploying new repositories, for installing Google Tag Manager to an app, and for deploying containerized applications, CMS or databases on Azure. Individual LCU components are also combined to create launch pads – comprehensive and often full stack automations that drastically simplify the process of assembling and launching cloud-based applications for various application use cases.

The following are a series of tutorials for deploying automated launch pads with Fathym’s three interfaces – web app, CLI or AI.
