# Open Source in the Enterprise

There are plenty of off the shelf tools and solutions to choose from, for just about any industry, but these solutions don't work for everyone.  Whether it be you're budget-impaired or that your business doesn't quite fit right, there are plenty of reasons not to choose one (and often more than one) of these over priced dinosaurs.  We can't afford to be handcuffed like that anymore, we need the freedom to move forward as technology moves forward, not after.

Back in my day, we used to enjoy the thrill of the build.  The art of integrating simple, specialized tools into a cohesive solution that solved the problems of our users.  I must admit though, there was a lot more to it because we were all building our own enterprise stacks, developing our own data layers, api layers, business layers, binding layers, presentation layers...  Its starting to sound like the worlds worst truffle.

We've all gotten a lot smarter sense then, and for those of you fortunate enough to never walk up hill, both ways, in the blistering cold while your server rack was melting down in the back closet...  I mean server room, you're welcome.  Its those trials and tribulations that led us to the current state of technology.  Where there is no shortage of open source and/or SaaS products available that allow us to pull out our canvas and paint solutions for our users in days and weeks, not months and years.
