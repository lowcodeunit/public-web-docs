## Create and Deploy

When getting started with a new application, you’re not only working the interface and functionality goals, but also on how to organize, build and deploy the application. This requires learning and managing a number of various technology skill sets before being able to reliably deliver a solution.

LowCodeUnit operates as a virtual development team that automates best practices for application delivery.  In order to help you focus on building applications and creating value, we built the platform to augment your team’s skills and do the heavy lifting.

[Using the platform](https://www.lowcodeunit.com/dashboard) radically reduces the time and work involved in getting devices connected, understanding their data, and delivering end-to-end customer driven IoT applications.
