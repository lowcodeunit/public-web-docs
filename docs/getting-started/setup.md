# Setting Up LowCodeUnit

Fathym LowCodeUnit enables you to rapidly develop, deploy, and maintain projects using best practice workflows for modern web.

In this getting started guide, you'll have your own application up and running in Fathym's LowCodeUnit Runtime, the micro-frontend engine that powers your projects.  We'll walk through connecting with GitHub, and once setup, show how to easily enable an end-to-end continuous integration and deployment environment for hosting your solutions.  Finally, we'll walk through how to make changes to and upgrade the applications you deliver on your domain.  

To kick things off, visit the [LowCodeUnit](https://www.lowcodeunit.com/dashboard) sign up page (no credit card required) and access the dashboard.

## LowCodeUnit Dashboard

Once signed in, the LowCodeUnit Dashboard will load with a free license.  Your all-in-one platform for project management, the dashboard is a control system for applications, DevOps, identity, hosting, QA, security and more.
